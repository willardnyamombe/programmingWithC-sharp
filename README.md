# **Programming With C-sharp**

I guess in this module I decided to work on a Number guessing game. I needed to learn the basic components of C# language, that is understanding all the syntax as well as the IDE for C#. 
#  IDE 
I used Visual Studio as my code editor. You can install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) here.
